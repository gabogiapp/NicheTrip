Post Name: 28M and lost in life after travelling fir 3 months
Honeymoon phase / adjustment, with the polar extremes. Quite normal.  It gets easier over time to go on trips and then back into work when required, fairly seamlessly and without a rollercoaster of moods. That's my experience, at least, beginning travel in my early 20s and now in my early 50s.

 I also found that the epic "get as far away as possible for as long as possible" thing moderates  with each time out. I began doing epic year long journeys all overland,  and later and later on it was reducing to 6 month, 4 month, 3 month,  2 month. 

I also came to love micro adventures, which could be 5-7 days or weekends,  but arguably that may come 'from' having exhausted the epic journeys. 

 I found,  and many others did too, that on longer outings you can hit a saturation point where it literally becomes - "Meh, another himalayam vista, another Shakti temple, another white sand tropical beach". Few believe that could happen but it does,  as our human capacity to rapidly acclimatise to incredible blessings and start taking them for granted like a background image, knows no bounds. In conclusion,  the early trips out are like a huge awakening as to what life experiences you've been missing out on, and it hits like a tsunami with the subsequent devastation when the wave eases off. We then start living for travel,  seeing our home and work phase as a pesky obstacle. This, I suspect will moderate significantly over time, as it did for me.
-------------
Literally did the same thing. Bounced from my corporate job at 30. Japan, Korea, Thailand for six months. Came back to Toronto and didn't care anymore. The trip changed my life.

I'm grinding away again on the ladder but the purpose isn't to make millions so I can be wealthy. It's to fund further travel. At the end of the day you'll need to work to put food in your mouth and a roof over your head until you hit FIRE.

Max out your RRSP, TFSA and FHSA. Anything left, put it into non registered. Go travel now while you can, and also invest.

Also, was in a funk from corporate burnout, and when I traveled I met my wife in Korea! Travel always opens doors that you thought were once walls.

Post Name: Met a stranger in Spain, ended up making a friend for life
this is how i met one of my best friends!! We were both solo traveling and met on a coffee tour. She complimented my shirt and the rest was history. i’ve visited her home country, stayed with her family. We’ve traveled to multiple countries together. We live on opposite sides of the world but our friendship never dwindles.
-------------
This is the thing about solo travel people don’t understand.

When I’m with friends the experiences are just not the same.

I went to Costa Rica alone and met 2 French guys on the bus and hungout with them the whole week.

Then visited them in Paris later that year. Then they visited me in London when I moved there then we all went to Brazil together a year later.

Countless other stories like that as well. 

Miss traveling
-------------
Post Name: Which countries food did you enjoy the most?
Malaysia, has such choice and insanely high standards
-------------
Mexico - so many cool places and the food is simply amazing.
-------------
Japan & Italy
-------------
Vietnam. I could honestly eat Vietnamese for breakfast lunch and dinner every day. I miss it so much.
-------------
If you couldn't find anything  you enjoyed in Mexico city or Oaxaca, it's not going to happen for you.

Post Name: A spontaneous trip to Italy changed my life.
brrrooo, we on the same wavelength!! glad you enjoyed your trip :)

When I retired five years ago I had three main goals: travel often, become a better volleyball official and try to live life to the fullest.

After being retired for almost 4 years and looking back at my life since retirement I saw that I was very happy officiating volleyball almost 12 months out of the year but the only travel I was doing was across the country working various volleyball tournaments.

With the help of a good friend, I realized that I kept putting off recreational traveling primarily because I was very hesitant to travel alone. It was at that time that I decided to make the time in my busy volleyball schedule and just give solo traveling a try.

I planned a 2 week trip to İstanbul for April 2023. About 5 days before my scheduled trip, my AirBnB host informed me they had COVID and I needed to find a new AirBnB ASAP, which I was able to do.

Long story short, I am now happily married to my AirBnB host and live half the year in İstanbul!

It is funny how much life can change on a dime!

My advice ... find the time to travel and enjoy what the world has to offer. 

You never know!

Post Name: Not having the time of my life
>  The waitress kinda has a weird reaction when I said it was just me. 
  
I promise you, it's all in your head. You think people will think it's weird or you're self conscious about it, so you look for any reason to validate that.  
  
Think about the last time you saw someone doing something alone. You can't. No one cares.
-------------
I just slipped down a mountain during a solo hike in the Lake District UK, 15,000km from home, and ripped up all my clothes, smashed my phone and ended up with a whole new array of cuts and bruises. Feeling pretty silly. I feel ya buddy.

However, I've had the best few weeks of my life prior to my mishap. It happens. There's always going to be good days and bad days, no matter where you are or whether you're travelling or not. Just gotta take the good with the bad, I figure.

Don't let a few shit occurrences dampen your whole trip. It's hard, I know! All the best.
-------------
I’m solo travelling through Australia at the moment and I completely understand. Any time I feel I’m having a bad day I just remind myself that I could also have a bad day back home and that makes me feel better about continuing my journey because the truth is no matter where we are or what we are doing we will have bad days. And if I can’t find friends to hangout with I just take myself out for a nice meal and treat myself (it does become less weird I promise)
-------------
The reality of it has ups and downs so don't beat yourself up for having bad days, I think those bad days are also meaningful experiences in their own way. Vent in a journal, watch a comforting TV show or movie, and give yourself some time to get settled in to a rhythm.
-------------
This 1000% 

The more you venture out alone, the more you realise no one thinks it's as weird as you do. Eventually, you won't think it's weird at all. 

I've been eating out alone for a long time, even at home. No one cares. They're happy to have your business. No one is judging you.

It will get better! Have fun! I understand those lonely and sad days traveling alone. I've been there too. But focus on the freedom and new sights and sounds you're experiencing. Some people never get the opportunity to do what they want, when they want, on their own terms, in a new location. You're in a unique position. Enjoy it, but don't feel guilty about they days you don't feel that great. It's natural to get pangs of loneliness and uncertainty. You'll grow your confidence with each new trip, I promise!

Post Name: Solo travel ruined my life at home afterwards
“Solo travel ruined my life at home afterwards”

Vs

“Solo travel revealed something to me about my preferences and how my life can be otherwise”

It sounds like a positive thing to me.
-------------
Sure, travel does 'change your brain' in a way...it changes your mentality, your outlook on life,in many cases.You learn and you grow.

Nothing really unusual there!

What to do? No reason why you can't start looking at your options.There are many ways of living abroad temporarily, working abroad or just traveling more in the future.

You need to try and be realistic too.. living anywhere also has downsides, and it's easy to remember only the positives about a place.Same thing for holiday romance I guess ;-)

Have you contacted this person since you went home? How did they react?
-------------
Travelling is very different than living abroad full time. 

If you move to live somewhere else your daily life will be similar - get up, go to work, grocery shopping, make dinner, sleep. You will need to deal with admin, pay bills and rent, commute, visit a dentist, clean your house, go to the post office, and do all other mundane life things. And on top of that, you might be home sick, you will be away from all your social network and support, people will speak a different langauge, you might get discriminated and feel like you don't belong etc.

Having said that, you might enjoy living abroad, but you will never know until you try. Have a look at r/expats to see how others who have tried feel about it.
-------------
you got a new reference point for how your life can be, and how things can feel.  it's a beautiful thing - lean into it and find a way to go to Europe if your curiosity continues to call for it.  you sound young and it's not going to get easier as you get older.

in the last few years - each time I came back from an intense trip, I came back feeling like a different 'shape' of a person, and I couldn't fit into the rhythm anymore.  It didn't go away for me - opposite of a 'vacation' where you're supposed to come out of it feeling recharged to keep life at home going.  This culminated into me eventually selling my things, quitting my job and pivoting into a new life where I'm able to chase my curiosities (my 'northstars'), even if the path to get to them isn't 100% clear.  You may resonate with this.  Be strategic and intentional but be open to things changing along the way.
-------------
This is often why we travel in the first place…. well said!
-------------
I would also add that visiting places versus living is like night and day.

Post Name: Anybody else still think about a one night stand you had while traveling?
I had a similar experience with a German girl. We tried to keep in touch and it ruined the magic a little - I learned a valuable lesson after that. Some people only come into your life for a moment and thats okay. I never saw her again but it was one of the best times of my life (we spent 4 days together). She took me to the airport when I left Germany and she gave me a lighter from her purse because she wanted to send me with something and that's all she had. It was sort of her way of being funny. I still have that lighter and the shot glass we drank from the night we met. Every once in a while I flick the lighter to see if there's still a flame. Last I checked it was still working.
-------------
You'll remember that the rest of your life. It will always be sweet.
-------------
[deleted]
-------------
Yup still think about her sometimes 10 years later. I think part of the allure is the fact we didn't have the chance to get annoyed by each other
-------------
Travel flings always stay with you
-------------
A guy I met at a hostel in gerogia in 2004. Never even exchanged real names. True hippie stuff. He kissed me under the soft sunlight and old pine trees. I'll never forget him. I hope he is doing well 20 years on.
-------------
Before Sunrise syndrome. It’s beautiful.
-------------
Limerence forms with great ease on the traveler's path.
-------------
Met a super hot Argentinian pro tennis player 12 years my junior in Mendoza. He invited me to play tennis at his club, then we went back to my hotel and made love all night. Definitely in my top 3 sex experiences. He added me on social media the next day and he still keeps in touch, so I think he enjoyed it too.
-------------
I don't understand how my posts related to solo travel don't get approved but stuff like this does lol.
-------------
sounds like sweet memories!
-------------
There's a certain beauty to letting beautiful experiences become memories and just that. I have a fond one of a German girl I spent a few days with in Maui. Funnily, we both discussed purposefully _not_ keeping in touch (not following each other on social media) and letting this amazing time become just a memory we think back on fondly. Just like the old days before the ubiquity of the internet. I don't regret it.

This sub is hilarious to be honest. I came also looking for genuine tips as well but it’s mostly stuff like this. I didn’t know one night stands were this deep lol

Lmao, the mods on this sub are definitely horny af.

Post Name: First solo trip in my life, day 1 and I’m crying. Is this normal? Anyone else felt like this?
Culture shock + jetlag + sleep deprivation can hit hard at the start of a trip. Give yourself some time to settle in. Feeling some fear and overwhelm doesn't mean the trip is "ruined" or not worth it. The reality of traveling alone can be intense so be gentle with yourself about it and identify healthy coping mechanisms on the shittier days - venting to your partner or in a journal, making sure you're taking care of your fundamental needs (sleep, food, etc), revisiting some familiar comforts (reading a book or something) and getting out on walks. With more time you'll feel more comfortable
-------------
One thing I found while solo travelling;

The highs are higher than at home, but the lows are also lower. Give it a few days before you let it get to you.
-------------
1. You’re just tired. Allow yourself to feel it and move through it. 

2. 30 is not “10 years too late”…you’re right on time for your life. Stop comparing your journey to anyone else’s or what society tries to tell you…it’s causing you unnecessary doubt/pain and those standards are a fallacy.

3. Solitude should not cause you pain. If it does, I would use some of your alone time to spend thinking about why it hurts to be with just yourself.

4. Be proud of yourself. Solo travel takes courage and you will always come back stronger and more knowledgeable about yourself. Be grateful to yourself for building a life where you’re able to do this 💗

You got this 💪

Post Name: Hostel roommate wants to fight over playing tiktoks in the middle of the night
Blowing smoke in someone's face is an easy way to a broken nose.
-------------
What’s funny (but not) about people like this is he DOESNT think he’s wrong. This story, to his friends, is about a house full of strangers who were assholes to him for no reason.

(Assuming this is true and isn’t the inverse story lol).
-------------
Absolute selfish behaviors. Japanese people are too polite. The cops would've been called in other countries.
-------------
Some really bizarre people travelling around Japan.

There was this guy in Tokyo who wanted to stop this guy next to his bed from snoring. So his solution was to bang as loud as he could against the wall with his fist. Didn't take long for him to be confronted lol.
-------------
The joy of being a traveller going around hostels is you don't need to stay more than one night in a bad place.

Just request a refund of any money for nights you haven't stayed and leave. I'm sure Osaka has dozens of very good hostels.
-------------
Review the place accordingly. They don't care about their guests, lowest score from me. This is like basic shared accommodation stuff.

Personally, I have dealt with unruly guests in hostels, and I'd assure they are all talk and no action, but I understand others being less confrontational. However, the hostel needs to deal with this.
-------------
lol right?  I wouldn’t jump *straight to* violence. But this guy certainly needs the *threat* of violence ASAP.
-------------
I was seriously wondering why the cops weren't called for a verbal threat. The host said please be patient, he's leaving. Just let it be.

Kick this jerk out of Japan already.
-------------
Post Name: First night in hostel ever, someone stole all of my stuff
Geez, that’s terrible. I’m so sorry this happened to you. The hostel should provide lockers! 

Depending on their policy, you could ask about reimbursement or that they waive your accommodation cost. The challenge is proving what you had and what was taken - I’m assuming he did not carry out the items in plain sight. 
In my experience, hostels assume no liability for anything, ever.  I hope the rest of your journey goes well.
-------------
In the future, you should being a padlock and lock up your stuff everytime you leave your hostel. You shouldn't trust anybody with your possessions especially in a shared room.
-------------
I am glad the thief has a tiny sliver of humanity and left you your passport.
-------------
My passport and cards stay with me in a money belt under my clothes. Hostels are not 5 star hotels.
-------------
If it doesn’t have lockers I won’t stay. Never would I ever think to leave my bag out if I’m not in the room. Even just going to the bathroom, everything goes in the locker.

Amazing pictures. And thanks for your detailed description!

Great pictures and cool experience but It does seem like an expensive and fiddly version of Nepal.

This is the kind of post I love. Thanks for the thoughtful post! Definitely adding this to my list.

Post Name: I travel 100+ nights a year for work. Here’s how I travel.
I always have some extra sealed bags of different sizes (for food, laundry, wet shirt, whatever). A few bags of instant coffee. Allergy pills. Big scarf.
-------------
I travel 100+ nights a year too (CLOSER TO 300). Agree with these and yes, leave early but more importantly (the thing i took yearsss to learn): let go of the illusion of control. Once you’re through security, you’re in airport time. Flights delayed, gates changed, planes swapped etc...it’s not personal. Have a book downloaded. Stretch. Hydrate. Don’t let the chaos rent space in your head. 

this post makes me wonder if i should  put together my full list too.
-------------
For 10- I have a reusable utensil set that lives in my laptop bag. Includes chopsticks and a straw.
-------------
All great tips, thanks!

A few I would add:
- check and see if your skincare offers travel or sample sizes for sale. Saves you having to transfer product to travel containers. 
- when traveling internationally bring your universal power converter and a power strip that includes usb ports to plug into it. Now you can plug all your things in.
-------------
I used to think I'd love travelling for work, so I did. It gets old when you have a family.
-------------
I have 2.5 million miles with UAL alone.  3,000 plus nights with Marriott alone.  I am tired.  Not traveling in 2020 due to Covid was a look into my future, and man, did I LOVE it!!!

Good travel tips, BTW.

#14 - stop traveling!  Lol.

Be safe, road warriors.
-------------
I take the laundry bag from every single hotel room I stay in whether I need it or not. I recently started bringing a small trash bag because the laundry bags usually have air holes in them.
-------------
I think travelling for work is one of those things that sounds cool because travelling is cool, but at the end of the day you're still working. I've found digital nomading really rewarding but would probably hate travelling for work. 

And yeah, if you have a family/want to start a family, definitely is not the move.
-------------
Wife and four kids at home. I’m looking for something off the road honestly. I have a client wants me on site next week and I haven’t even told my wife yet because I was supposed to be home all week.

Post Name: Faroe Islands gem of the north
Spent 10 days on holidays and it was one the most amazing travel of my life. The sceneries are wild, but the weather is kinda rough and super humid. It's quite easy to travel around but the island in itself might be pretty expensive. 
 Pictures were taken in different places such as :
- Kalsoy Island
- Mulafossur Waterfall
- Kirkjubour 
- Tjornuvik

Post Name: what’s a specific food item you had while traveling that you now crave fortnightly?
Gyros in Athens
-------------
Pastes de nata in Lisbon
-------------
Very specific but the B-12 Morinaga vitamin jelly drinks from Japanese 7-11 😂 I had to cut myself off when I was there, had almost 2 a day
-------------
Legit ramen in Japan. My first experience with it was life-changing.
-------------
Banh Mi's in Vietnam. GOAT-tier sandwich, could eat multiple per day for weeks straight
-------------
Pastel de nata in Portugal

Jamón ibérico in Spain

Tacos al pastor in CDMX

Okonomiyaki in Japan
-------------
Freaking suppli from Rome.  I can’t stop thinking about them, and all we got nearby are Arrancini which is not the same thing.  Making it is a bit of a hassle at home too 😕
-------------
tlacoyos, tamales oaxaqueños, and really most other street food from mexico city
-------------
Good Kebabs specifically the ones from Berlin.
-------------
Gulab Jamun. India just ruined me for food anywhere else honestly.
-------------
NOLA beignets.
-------------
Chocolate croissants in Paris. I had a small one every morning!!
-------------
- pho in vietnam
- khao soi in north thailand
- pizza in italy
- pasta in italy
- bread in france
- wine in France, italy, spain and portugal
-------------
Recency bias here too; I was in San Diego last weekend and drunkenly demolished a street dog. Bacon, onion, peppers, mayo, mustard.. It was so good and I want two right now.
-------------
Turkish food is delish! I have fond memories of grabbing cig kofte for a quick snack on the go. Vegan wrap made with bulgur "meat" and pomegranate molasses. Easy to find in any Turkish city, tasty and cheap. 

Also simit.
-------------
Pan con tomate in Spain— so simple and so good.
-------------
Takoyaki

Yessss and tzatziki 24/7
-------------
I was in Athens a couple weeks ago and I can’t stop thinking about the gyros I ate there. It’s three or four times more expensive in the UK 😭
-------------
I went to a Champion's League soccer game at FC Porto's stadium in Porto and they hardly sold anything at the concession stand, but they did have a pastel de nata and espresso combo for like €3. 

Having a pastel de nata with fresh espresso while watching professional sports was the life. Completely ruined American sports for me
-------------
Japanese Daifuku with the strawberry. My sweet tooth is screaming. I miss Japan 😂
-------------
Oh Vietnam. That country ruined me. Pho, Banh Mi, fresh Vietnamese coffee while waiting out a rain storm, matcha everything,  broken rice, Secret Garden resteraunt, the egg pancake thing, the dumplings I never found out what was jn but were glorious, spring rolls beautiful and light..... I loved every meal.

ETA : banh xeo! Not egg at all, I was tiredly misremembering ingredients. Delicious.
-------------
This will be what I miss most about living in Germany. You cannot get kebab/döner in the US at all.
-------------
When I was an Au Pair in France I worked in a boarding school during the day. The kitchen staff would make the boarders pain au chocolat every morning, and eating a fresh-out-of-the-oven pain au chocolat has permanently ruined me for all other pastries.
-------------
When I die, bury me in tzatziki

Post Name: What's one tourist activity you did out of FOMO that you regretted?
About 20 years ago, I visited the Tiger Temple in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. I'd seen something about it on TV and it claimed to be a sanctuary dedicated to animal conservation and that sort of thing.

I regretted going almost immediately. Got there and the tigers were very obviously drugged. I know the temple denied any accusations of drugging the animals, but the way those tigers slept through being manhandled and posed for pictures was not natural. 

Years later, it came to light that the temple was involved in the illegal animal trade, amongst other things. It was shut down in 2016. If there's one touristy thing I've done I wish I could take back it's giving my money to that place.
-------------
Riding elephants in India. I will regret that until I die. I was told it was a must-do by my fellow travellers. I looked that Elephant in his eye and have never felt more guilty.
-------------

-------------
I decided to buy a drink which was a local shot of licorice and salt liqueur in Copenhagen….

I can still taste it 5 years later
-------------
going to the monkey temple when you’re deathly afraid of monkeys is definitely a choice 😂 


way to face your fears OP!
-------------
20 years ago I rode an elephant in northern Thailand and couldn’t wait to get off. It did not seem like they treated them well, and the elephants had to be coaxed to walk. I regretted it a lot and never did animal tourism again.
-------------
90€ for a 25 min ride with Gondola in Venice. Yeah, maybe I should have listen to all the people that said take it either too early or during the sunset, and not on "highways" but small canals. I did it out of FOMO and really regret it. Too much "traffic", not relaxing at all, and nothing special.

Next day, I took the vaporetto at night, and it was way more cool experience for a fraction of cost of a  gondola ride.
-------------
A capybara cafe in Japan. It was the saddest thing. The poor capybara was completely disinterested in the hoard of humans and cats surrounding it (I think they cheaped out on getting a capybara buddy and subbed in a litter of cats instead). It is never taken out of the small cafe and never will be for its entire life.

 I really wanted to believe that it could be ethical but the experience confirmed that any wildlife experience that allows you to touch the animals does not have the welfare of the animal in mind. & yet, as upsetting as it is, this still isn't as cruel as how we treat cows, pigs, and chickens in the animal agriculture industry.
-------------
I paid extra $ for the freak show at a real life circus (probably earlier than 2008) or maybe a fair? and got to meet the littlest person alive - her name was joyti amge and she was just sitting there on a little pedestal smiling at everyone and she seemed so sweet. I felt horrible as a lookey loo because I legitimately thought the freak show would be like a Ripleys with taxidermy and not actual real people.
-------------
OMG - I did exactly the same thing in Bali! I was terrified the entire time at the Monkey Temple that one would bite me (not helped by the ads for the Rabies Clinics near the entrance).
-------------
My wife and I decided to walk the Hollywood Walk of Fame from Argyle Ave to the Chinese Theater ( ~ 20 min walk) because we thought it would be nice to see all the stars. NOPE. The biggest mistake of our life. Homeless people, drug addicts, and crazy people everywhere. We were ready to run and our heads were on a constant swivel.
-------------
Swimming with the pigs in the Bahamas.  The epitome of a tourist trap.  Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

Long neck tribe in northern Thailand.  Oy, talk about feeling exploitative

Not that I regret it but I didn’t need to go to the Red Light District in Amsterdam.

Going to patong for the partying and bar hoping experience.

It wasn't fun. It was disgusting. I have nothing against the Ladyboys, but I am revolted with the sex tourists.

Yep. I was uninformed.

Four corners monument in the USA. We had just started our RV trip around the US/Canada and everyone told us it was a must see. It was not. It’s not even across the four actual corner state lines which it claimed to be (Arizona/Colorado/New Mexico/Utah).

Takeshita Street in Harajuku. Just sandwiched in with people on a narrow street
-------------
Going on a cruise. My ex always wanted to go but I was reluctant. The boat was nice, food and drinks were great, still felt like I was trapped in a mall for a week.
-------------
Seeing the mermaid in Copenhagen.
-------------
The Whitney Plantation in New Orleans. It’s an amazing, yet somber place. Unfortunately we had a guide who talked in a quiet voice and too much about herself. I think SO MUCH MORE could be done here. I wanted to feel more. I wanted the people on the tour to take it more seriously, almost as if we were in Auschwitz. I’m hoping it was the bad guide. Please go if you’re in NOLA, maybe it will be better for you.
-------------
In Iceland in early April at thingviller we had booked the snorkel swim between the tectonic plates - so we were at that park for a different thing a few days before our booking and saw some very cold and miserable looking snorkel swimmers returning from their tour shivering in their wetsuits and I’m realizing that in my own ten layers of extremely warm specialized clothing I’m still so freezing that my eyeballs felt like freezer burned ice cubes and I’ve never cancelled a booking so fast.
-------------
Pretty much everything in Dubai
-------------
Went to Vegas. It was not our cup of tea. Noisy, crowded, artificial, and we don't care much for gambling. The best part was Hoover Dam and Death Valley.
-------------
Bourbon Street. It was annoying and gross to even walk on for like 3 minutes.
-------------
I've got a few.

I recently saw O in Las Vegas. I was there mid week, so there weren't a lot of options. I saw La Reve years ago and loved it, but figured I should go see an actual cirque du soleil show. Oh man, it was not my cup of tea and If I had any way to escape I would have. 

The 9/11 Museum in NYC. I love museums. I love history. But I reached a point where a bunch of young Gen Zers were taking mocking selfies that I lost it and started crying and had to leave the museum early.  On a similar note for some reason I decided to start my first day in DC with the holocaust museum right as they opened. That made it a very depressing day. 

The Salem Witch Museum. For some reason I thought it was much bigger than it was. After ding the two "shows" I asked the staff in the gift shop where the rest of the museum was. "Honey, you've seen everything. If you aren't buying anything you need to go."
-------------
Same place, but the bridge. There's a well known bridge that was built with forced labour by prisoners of the Japanese in the second world war in horrifying conditions. The bridge that is still standing is a more recent addition, the POW built bridge has a few remaining pillars visible near the current one.


My great uncle was held prisoner by the Japanese and some of my wife's relatives had died there.


The place is a tourist attraction, sure, but it was treated so casually it was quite upsetting (and I'm not one to get moved by much). The most jarring thing was the behaviour of the big groups of Japanese tourists who were intent on taking photos of them smiling, cheering and waving whilst standing on the bridge. I would love to have seen how they reacted if they'd visited the nearby war museum that showed in distressing detail how Japan treated their prisoners just a few decades earlier.

Came here for this; had the same experience in Thailand. I was ashamed of myself the whole time.

I heard everyone there is wearing a diaper. I've literally never been tempted to do NYE in Times Square.

-------------
When you know better, you do better. This was widely acceptable until just a decade or so ago.
-------------
Yeah same thing but 15 years ago. Rode an elephant near Chiang Mai named Mikael after tagging along with some friendly Danish guys I met on a jungle tour. Had a damn picture of it viewable on my Facebook profile for a whole year before I stumbled across an article about how exploitative/cruel those places are. I should have known better. Sorry Mikael.

I felt like that in a mini pig cafe in Japan. Something felt off and the pigs didn't seem happy. I won't do it again.
-------------
Yep I love Japan but they have way too many unethical animal cafes. It’s really sad.
-------------
Yep this is pretty much any animal cafe in Japan. I really really wish tourists would stop going. Japan is advanced in some ways but animal welfare is leagues behind the west. There are barely any laws regarding keeping exotic animals, you can buy meerkats, prairie dogs, fennec foxes etc at mall pet shops with no license. Zoos are very sad compared to what we’re used to in the west.

I do think that cat and dog cafes can be ok. Where I live in Japan there are some cat cafes that have rescue cats and adopt them out. But some do just have purebred cats in a confined space.
-------------
I went to an owl cafe in Japan, it was just a bunch of owls on perches with chains around their legs.
-------------
It also smells like urine quite often there. I wonder if it used to be a better experience.
-------------
What, exactly, sounds enticing about swimming with pigs?
-------------
Yes. This! It was not fun at all. They expect food from tourists and will nip at you incessantly.  The water was full of pig poop.  Wouldn’t do that again!

This! Swimming with shitting aggressive pigs. Pass

Used to live in LA and a friend from Sydney visited me. While I was at work she went to Hollywood, and at dinner she was like “I think I ended up in the ghetto part of Hollywood” and I just laughed bc girl that’s ALL of Hollywood.

Avoid the tourist shops and walk of fame, but go go to one of the old movie palaces or the Oscar museum and you’re in for a treat!

Haha.  When my wife and I got married we had family flying in from around country to our wedding.  We lived in Orange County and our wedding was in south Orange County.  Since we lived in Socal we told family members that if they wanted suggestions for the beach they could ask us.  We also said that most of LA was a dump and traffic was terrible.

Regardless my sister-in-law made my brother go to Hollywood because ... I have no idea.  And not only that - she insisted on booking a hotel there for our wedding.  They saw the shit, ghetto streets and were obviously miserable.  My brother then suggested they leave and get a hotel in OC as we recommended for obvious reasons.  She threw a tantrum and he eventually decided to just come down on his own.

After our wedding, a few weeks later they announced their divorce.  True story.

Wait what the fuck the four corners aren't actually the four corners???

My wife took me there with the promise that there was a Warhammer Store.

It’s closed on Wednesday we found out.

I studied abroad in Copenhagen during Covid, while it was still closed to tourists, and I would go hang out in the park sometimes and sit across from the mermaid statue. The park was so peaceful, there was no one around, and there was this quiet loneliness to the statue that really spoke to me at the time. I genuinely love that statue.

I have no idea why it's treated like a tourist attraction. It's not a particularly impressive or great work of art. It was, like, the perfect thing for me specifically, when I was a sad lonely student in the middle of covid, feeling like a *fish out of water* living in a foreign country. IDK what the appeal would be to a tourist rushing to and from it with a crowd of other people.

We had a *very* serious black woman who made it all come alive in a horrific fashion. “Sold down the river” had taken on a whole new meaning

The 9/11 Museum is probably one of the most powerful experiences I've ever had. I also cried. I'm sorry your visit was ruined by some tone def kids.

NYC is great to visit, Times Square is not all there is to see there.
-------------
I never get this sentiment. 

It’s literally an intersection. You just walk through it. You don’t have tor “do” anything.  It’s an intersection of some streets, above a train station. Just walk through it. You just walk through it. I don’t understand how you’d “regret” it, it’s an intersection. You don’t have to buy anything, do anything.

I live here and generally avoid it (just because most of us don’t go that way anyway), but when I do need to walk through there, it’s a fun 10 minute walk. It’s nice to see the crowds and the fucked up Elmo costume guys. It’s literally an intersection. Bottom to top is a half mile long intersection. You just walk through the intersection the same way you walk through any intersection.

And immediately north of Times Square is the best urban park in the entire world. And immediately south of it is the busiest train station in the entire New World, the Empire State Building, the Chelsea highline, Bryant Park and the library. Immediately to the east is 30 Rock and immediately to the west is the best linear park in the continent which is also the busiest bike path in the New World.
-------------
I did it once but it was a deal through the W hotel that still makes no sense. You had to book a room and then  It was around $100 for multi-course dinner. I was just out of college, so that was a huge expense.. but, seated at the table next to us was Colin Powell and Mike Bloomberg. From the hotel, you got access to go out into Tine Square- down the center part between the corrals of people. You could freely walk up and down the whole street with no real restrictions. We could stand right below the stage where presenters and performers were. We children go back to the hotel for the bathroom or drinks. Also, it was unseasonably warm. All in all, it was an incredible experience.
-------------
Lived in NYC since 1970. Never even thought about going to Times Square on NYE.

I've drank moonshine, poitin, raki, absinthe, tons of different local liqueurs all over the world.

Nothing tasted as bad as that. It wasn't even the alcohol taste. It was the combo of the strongest licorice with a salt that tasted like it came off of satan's ballsack.

The lady at the bar said, 'oh there's worse than this one'

I went to a mini pig cafe in Japan and honestly it is one of my biggest travel regrets. I should never have done it.


Japan has such a sketchy record on animal rights.
-------------
The bastardization of real nature in the big city cafes make me sad. There are really cool nature places in Japan -- go birdwatching from a birdwatching cafe in Hokkaido! Or, if you want the "intertwined human and nature" thing, then at least feed some deer in Miyajima or watch the rabbits on Okunoshima. There's still some questionable dynamics here, but at least they're not being trapped in a room for profit.
-------------
No offense- what else did you expect ?
-------------
Exactly. I can do that at my HOA pool.

It is. The monument was placed according to the survey boundaries which were done over 150 years ago so they don't form exact straight lines, but the boundaries are legally defined to be where the monument is.

That sounds like the only reasonable way to do it

Post Name: I was on an American Airlines CRJ-700 flying into DCA last night
My best friend is a flight attendant based out of Baltimore/DC. Needless to say she was rattled today. The news/politicians seem to forget sometimes that those were real humans on those flights and that helicopter. Kids with futures, family members, friends. It’s such a horrible avoidable tragedy, one I hope our nation quickly learns from.
-------------
We pilots aren’t very happy about the situation either but trying to wait for the investigation. What gets me is that this preliminary info makes it seem like the airliner was just doing a very normal operation that many of us have done many times, and they were doing it well, but it didn’t work that time. I’ve been mentally flying that exact approach, I can see it, and I’m really not sure what the CRJ should’ve done better.
-------------
Based on your pictures, your AA flight was also a PSA Airways flight. I’m not an expert on aviation or airlines, but I imagine the crew on your trip could’ve known the crew on Wichita flight. 

It’s an incredible tragedy, and we may never get the answers we want. Shock and grief are tricky things. Play some Tetris and/or talk to someone (a professional) about this experience if you feel comfortable and are able.
-------------
My class of 2007 lost a classmate from Minnesota. She was a mother, left behind 2 young boys and her husband. Truly one of the hardest working most intelligent woman of our class. She is sorely missed by our community. Still hard to believe.
-------------
My heart is heavy. I feel so sad. I pray for the families and the lost souls. I am glad you are okay, I can’t imagine what you are feeling. I hope they get to the bottom of this, it’s a very unnerving feeling. 

On a side note, I did some digging today and I read that there actually had been a few near miss accidents with helicopters near Reagan that pilots reported, but nothing was done about it.  I just don’t get it. They only fix things when something goes terribly wrong instead of preventing.
-------------
I’m sorry that you’re going through this and for the overload of emotions you must be feeling. 

I’m not sure this will help with the anger, but maybe. That area has had helicopter flying lanes for decades with very specific flight paths. This wasn’t a one-off training exercise that was randomly approved next to DCA. Hundreds, if not thousands, of pilots have made that same flight. This was the action of a single pilot, or helicopter crew as a whole, going against rules and precautions that have been around longer than they were alive. 

That doesn’t change anything or bring anyone back, but at least it wasn’t a braindead government decision made on a whim. It was a tried and true method that had a single, catastrophic failure.
-------------
Sad to hear this, must have been pretty jarring and I can’t imagine being a passenger or crew on a plane so near to an accident.  The CRJ700 is a very reliable aircraft and has never had a hull loss from a crash prior to this.  Just crazy negligence on behalf of the helicopter pilots, may they rest in peace.
-------------
High jacking the top comment to answer the question about the military flight. There was not a military exercise at DCA. The helicopters in the area are actually transport for “VIPs” (Secretary of Defense, Generals, Admirals, important military personnel or whatever) they use helicopters as opposed to driving around the greater DMV area for a variety of reasons. It may be released at some point but they very well could’ve been picking up someone from DCA. Or they were conducting flights to get required hours. Which Army pilots struggle to get enough of, but if you want to learn about that go peak at the r/army or r/armyaviation subreddits. All in all it is extremely common to have military helicopters and planes around airports. We pray that this never happens again.

A lot had to go wrong in the right sequence for this tragedy to happen. That doesnt mean nothing will change. The NTSB does their investigations pretty well. If they have recommendations it will be informed and vetted.

Why the helo thought they had visual separation but didnt. Why they climbed above the ceiling. We may get answers we may not.

The public may want to scapegoat an individual because thats easy. But the systems in place should account for rogue mishaps and poor decisions.
-------------
>This was the action of a single pilot, or helicopter crew as a whole, going against rules and precautions that have been around longer than they were alive. 

There's never a single reason a tragedy happens. Even though helicopter pilots made a mistake of not maintaining max 200ft elevation, the helicopter route intersects the runway 33 approach path with only 100ft of elevation separation. 

This is an extremely dangerous setup as we've seen. 

Not to mention nighttime and probable use of night vision which restricts the field of view, and separate radio channels so pilots couldn't hear what the others were saying when talking to ATC
-------------
No communication failures - air traffic control and PAT pilot communicated and agreed on action. Helicopter was suppose to pass behind the plane. Pilot just didn’t execute it.
-------------
When I lived in DC, I was a rower out of the Potomac Boathouse and the sheer volume of helicopters that were fly up and down that river then is staggering, and I’m sure it’s much more now. I believe that the base the helicopter flew out of is fairly close/across the river from Reagan Airport as well. 

There have been some interesting comments, in r/helicopters as well about the accident. A number of them being army pilots commenting on how the upper brass has changed the focus over the last 20 years. They were saying how difficult it is to get enough flight hours and that many of them have been complaining that there’s going to be some type of a major accident due to this. My understanding is that they are told to focus on other duties with flying almost being like a reward versus something that they actively do on a daily basis.

My ex was a USMC helicopter pilot 30 years ago and when he was in, he would fly sorties four or five times a day, five or six days a week. It sounds like that has changed now and these guys are lucky to fly once a week.
-------------
A coworker of mine used to be an Army Aviator, he remarked they were probably wearing NVG’s as well which make everything very fisheye feeling. Said he wouldn’t be surprised if they lost visual contact with the plane for just the handful of seconds needed, horrible tragedy

I’m a flight attendant. Being that they are a small regional I’m almost certain your crew could have known some of the other crew. Even at my own larger legacy airline we have quite a few members on our work app that have posted that came from PSA. At least one of our current FAs knew one of 5342’s crew. It’s a small and more tight knit world at the regionals. The whole flight attendant/pilot community is shook right now but it def probably hits harder than we all could imagine for them right now. God bless.

Tetris may inhibit the creation of intrusive memories.

[How Playing Tetris Tames The Trauma Of A Car Crash](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/09/523011446/how-playing-tetris-tames-the-trauma-of-a-car-crash)

> Last week a group of researchers from the U.K. and Sweden published a study reporting that playing just 20 minutes of Tetris — in research parlance, a "Tetris-based intervention" — following an automobile accident can help prevent the formation of the painful, intrusive memories that can follow trauma.

> The new research looked at 71 patients who had presented to the John Radcliffe Hospital emergency room in Oxford, England, within six hours of being in a car accident. While waiting to be seen, patients were first asked to recall their trauma and recount the worst moments that sprang to mind. (If it helps, they were paid.) They were then randomized to either play Tetris for 20 minutes on a handheld Nintendo DS XL system or to instead fill out an activity log of what they had experienced since arriving at the hospital. The latter group served as the control.

> The gamers were found to have 62 percent fewer intrusive memories in the first week after their accident than the control group. What's more, their bad memories diminished more quickly than in controls.

Post Name: Anywhere in the US for a 4-5 night trip of just stuffing my face and eating anything and everything, where do I go?
New Orleans 
-------------
For eating, I’d go New Orleans or NYC
-------------
New Orleans would be my #1 but Chicago is also up there. I've seen food bloggers go on missions to eat cuisine from every single country and it's actually possible in Chicago. 

A "lesser-known" foodie city I would also argue is Minneapolis. Diverse offerings thanks to the various immigrant communities, and award winning restaurants (don't miss Vinai or Diane's place). Just don't visit in the winter months.
-------------
New York City.

The 5 boroughs are full of every restaurant of every nation at any price point.

You want a yak momo?  You can get it in Woodside.  Flushing besides having the usual Asian choices has some excelleant Urgahyr and other ethnic Chinese cuisine.  Some of the best bagels and fixin's can be had at the Lower East Side.  Arthur Avenue in the Bronx is like going to Italy.  Little Russia in Brighton beach, etc.

  
Here are some links from Culinary Backstreets, the successor to Serious Eats for restaurant recommendations

  
[Where to Eat in Queens, New York - Culinary Backstreets](https://culinarybackstreets.com/stories/queens/where-to-eat-in-queens)
-------------
Flushing, Queens, New York City has probably the densest, most diverse array of eating options in the world. It's certainly the most so in the United States.
-------------
Los Angeles has an amazing food scene. You can spend $4, $40 or $400 and find some great eats. Street hot dogs, mochi donuts, the boba tea/donut/bakery combo places, all sorts of Mexican food, even the guys selling fruit in the street (if they're cutting it fresh and keeping it on ice).
-------------
Portland, it’s a vastly underrated food city
-------------
I've been to 50 states and I came to say this. Hands down this.
-------------
Beignets, muffuletta, etouffee, crawfish, gumbo.... such a good call.
-------------
Quebec City and Montreal are solid too. I like the Charleston, SC idea too (low country boil, shrimp and grits and an oyster roast, all day)
-------------
when people talk about nyc for food, they arent thinking of michelin star spots. more like hole in the wall. also, jackson heights is the most amazing spot in the entire country if you’re into ethnic cuisine. and dirt cheap by normal US standards, let alone nyc standards.

Post Name: Are we crazy to fly 11 hours to Europe for only 4 nights of travel?
Travel any way that works for you.
-------------
I mean, I wouldn't do it but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.
-------------
I was going to say that I wouldn't pay for an expensive flight for only 4 days, but then I checked and you can do USA to Copenhagen return for under $400.

I still wouldn't do it myself for only 4 days. But that flight cost is half what I expected.
-------------
If you can manage the jetlag then why not? We do Tokyo for 4 nights once a year which is a 13h flight for us. Only thing that matters if you're ok with it. Who cares what others think
-------------
Not crazy. Go for as long as you can and have a good time. People gatekeep too hard around here about how long you need to be somewhere to really see it. If you can only afford or only have 4 nights of travel then travel 4 nights. 

I once drove 8 hours on a Saturday to watch a football game until midnight and drove home Sunday. It was worth every mile.
-------------
We do it 2-3 times per year. 13-15 hours flying, one-way. 3-4 nights in London or Paris or Amsterdam, fly home. It’s exhilarating. 

We are both pushing 60.
-------------
Sure, but they should realize that an 11-hour flight will either knock you out like a rock, or worse, leave you unable to sleep at all when you land.

When I flew 14 hours to Japan, I felt like I’d drank a whole bottle of alcohol the moment I arrived. Sleeping was impossible, and I basically wasted the entire first day feeling dizzy and like garbage. The second day was just me catching up on lost sleep.

So honestly 4 nights is a no-go for me. at least a week if you wanna really enjoy your destination.

  
If OP wants advice: Do it if that’s your only option, you'd have fun anyways. Just make sure to sleep well on the plane and avoid coffe!
-------------
I mean, that's how it worked out for you, it's not a universal experience. My flight to Japan was almost 18 hours (including a brief stopover) and while I was tired when I landed, after a nice dinner and a good night's sleep I was 100% the following day.

Post Name: Unexpected places you found great food in
My memory of Doolin Ireland from decades ago is that it has 4 buildings. A hotel, a restaurant, and 2 pubs. The restaurant was amazing. It was like a Michelin star chef decided to move to the country and serve solid, tasty food.

I’ve been to Thailand numerous times over the years, but the best Thai green curry I ever had was at this Irish pub in the heart of Cusco! Peru already had some of the best food, but I think about that meal often
-------------
Unironically, I had some really good bratwurst in Taipei of all places at a night market.

Post Name: Where Has Social Media Turned Hidden Gems into Expensive Tourist Traps?
I would say social media is a symptom and not the cause. The number of flight routes increased by 4 times from 2000 to nowadays, while the number of commercial flights have doubled. People are just travelling more and having easier access to more varied destinations.

Partly due to rise of low cost airlines, partly due to people from developing countries getting wealthier, partly due to lifestyle changes (people getting married and having kids later in life, and more people not getting married and having kids).
-------------
It might just be me coping, but with every new fad destination I feel that previous ones start to ease up with crowds and prices. Maybe not back to pre-boom levels, but more reasonable. 

As someone constantly in Japan for work/travel, it feels like it hit a peak in 2023-2024 and is now starting to slow down a bit for western tourists. The change is exchange rate may be part of the reason too.
-------------
I like going down the “rabbit hole” of a country. There’s always the obvious places in most countries but, beyond that, are untouched gems. We all just have to dig deeper. I literally will just get Google Maps and click on bizarre locations and look at the pictures. I found many great places that way.
-------------
I like how we blame social media like thr main problem isn't just more people on earth and more people traveling.


Not being an influencer doesn't make us not part of the greater problem.


Review sites, google, reddit, instagram, tiktok etc are all sources where people find iut the most popular and highest rated shit to do. Before that it was forums, before that it was books and agents.


We're decades past only overzealous travelers being the only ones in the know.

If we posted about it on the internet they would just become the next places. I’ll pass on sharing.

International travel is also a lot more accessible to the less adventurous thanks to translator apps, maps apps, and easy online booking.

I've been going to Japan since 2008-ish. There are way more international tourists now but it's also infinitely easier to get out into the countryside without transportation & hotel booking issues. My total experience is better with less faffing around and getting lost and fewer people who are wary of foreigners. Trade-offs.
-------------
People are making more money than ever but housing costs in western countries have risen faster than that. The result is a massive increase in spending on things like vacations, because people have plenty of disposable income and still can't afford a house.
-------------
I hope so. It seems like every other person I know has a trip planned to Japan.

Seriously…”Cancun” and “hidden gem” in the same sentence. Be for fucking real

Post Name: The hottest club in Chicago is the Real ID Pop Up in the Loop…
It’s got everything…
-------------
I feel like it’s almost faster to get an emergency passport than wait in line for a real ID if you need to fly so soon
-------------
Just a reminder…if you have a passport you don’t NEED a real ID. The Secretary of State, himself, said that the reason for such long lines is because people think they need one when they don’t. 

https://news.wttw.com/2025/03/10/illinois-secretary-state-alexi-giannoulias-real-ids-future-digital-driver-s-licenses

I think it makes sense to get one, but if you have a valid passport then there is NO rush to get it before May 7. Wait until after the 7th and save yourself the headache.
-------------
I was there yesterday. It took 2 hours and 50 mins from parking a block away to paying for that parking upon my exit. So, I’d say it was at least a 2.5 hour process from back of the line to walking out the door. It was actually an enjoyable experience because I made friends with the girl in front of me and we talked the whole time.

Procrastination is the name of this club.

You know that thing, where a 65 year old lady yells at the clerk for turning her away because she didn't bring a 2nd bill that shows her address, and they're the person right in front of you in line? Yeah it's full of that.
-------------
To be fair we’ve only known about this since 2005 when GW Bush signed it into law

Post Name: Cars are banned in Lincoln Square for 10 days. We made some benches for you to enjoy. Bring a friend, and leave something on the street to help activate it
If you’ve got money to spend, I think doing so at the businesses on these stretch would be a good idea. Show them that they can maintain or exceed normal levels of profit in a car free zone.
-------------
Wish Chicago would embrace more closed off streets.  Love how it is done in Europe
-------------
That stretch of Lincoln would be so much better as a walking street, anyway!
-------------
This is awesome! I don't know why they don't get close this off permanently. It's always a mess driving through here.
-------------
This is the most informed take I’ve seen, because the bottom line is what will help change business owners’ attitudes, not weird condescension from those who want cars abolished.
-------------
Literally looking up a coffee shop on that stretch right now. they're getting a brand new customer right here specifically because it's car free. I'll be riding my bike up there.
-------------
They can't. Parking meter deal means that the city has to pay for any meters taken out of service as if they still existed.


Thanks Daley!
-------------
Also, business owners are typically very against removing any parking in front of their businesses. Even with an Alderman as bike/pedestrian friendly as Matt Martin, that’s the reason he hasn’t fully endorsed closing this segment to cars full time.
-------------
That is the same exact concern business owners in Europe had.  Those areas are packed with people now.  You can also compromise to have bollards that pop up and block traffic during certain times.  I know one size fits all doesn't always work, but if I recall they were successful during covid here. Let the restaurants put tables in the street at night, people will show up. Lincoln Square is a perfect spot for this.

Being blackout and taking long walks is how lot of folks end up in the river
-------------
Hey no hate glad your good. but this might be a wake up call to learn you limits.
-------------
Worked out for you this time


Be safe OP
-------------
Probably 8 years ago I got blackout at a work event. I took the redline and then apparently sat down on a curb in uptown and passed out leaning against a newspaper box. 

Some guy biking home stopped, pulled me up, got my address and walked me home. 

I think about him a lot. No clue who he was but there are good people out there.

(And I haven’t gotten that drunk since)
-------------
Not everyone gets a second chance. Don’t waste yours

I am glad you're safe. Please get help getting blackout drunk often and going for long walks does not sound safe. Take care.

That probably won't happen the next time. 

Call or stop by and see someone in your Employee Assistance Program. 

This repetitive behavior is EXACTLY how we've ended up with the posts about a "serial killer dumping people in the river".

Contrary to what people think, blackout drunk is not stumbling and bumbling drunk. 

Most of the time you appear to others to be in control and not in distress. However, you're essentially on autopilot without any sense if where or what you're doing. When you fall into the water you will not even realize you're in water or drowning.

Chicago is one of the best cities in the world- it's also probably one of the worst and most dangerous for blackout drunks.

When I lived in Milwaukee some lady got blackout drunk on the East Side during Harleys 100th & passed out sitting on the kerb leaning up against a trash can. No one noticed, or if they did they decided it was someone else's problem & ignored her. 6am the next morning the street sweeper came down Brady to clean up & from the cab of the truck the driver thought it was a pile of garbage spilled out from the can & drove over 'the pile' to clean it up. 

She was pronounced dead at the scene. I was walking my dogs a few blocks away & remember the screaming. How the screaming faded, the utter silence after. Then all the noise, yelling, screaming, wailing, sirens. 

Brady was shut down for hours, they moved the after block party to downtown, I think. The guy who was driving the street sweeper was shattered, they kept trying to interview him but all he could get out was that he thought she was a pile of garbage before he'd start sobbing hysterically. They finally stopped trying to interview him. 

All her friends said that she had a habit of getting blackout drunk & wandering off to find odd places to pass out in. They talked about her waking up in trees, on roofs, in a dumpster once... they said they were used to her disappearing while drinking & just assumed she'd show up later that day to start up the drinking again talking about how she woke up under someone's porch or something. They found out about her death by seeing it on the news. 

Milwaukee instituted safety officers that would walk the length of block parties after they shut down specifically to poke anything human shaped/sized & do garbage pick up before the sweepers were allowed through.
-------------
I called the cops on a someone who passed out on the curb at Wabash and Randolph a few years ago. I couldn’t wake him and thought he might be dead. The cop seamed annoyed and was asking me all kinds of questions and wanted my ID.  I don’t know, found him here and he doesn’t belong here. Help him. Jerk.

Seriously. Use this as a wake up call, OP. Nothing wrong with drinking and partying. But if you’re blacking out, especially regularly enough for it “to be a known thing,” that becomes a problem.
-------------
Don't be a statistic! Get help, seriously!
-------------
Yeah, the best thing the poster can do to show their gratitude is to probably stop drinking. Nothing to be ashamed about. Lots of good people have stopped drinking because of tendencies like this 
-------------
If you have a history of blacking out, I dont think you can brag about your high tolerances for anything
-------------
This answer is exhibit A in support of the original concern. Citing high tolerance to sweep away concerns is such a deep shade of red flag it's practically black.

You've been given another chance. Take it.
-------------
Me. And now that I don’t drink people will comment on how I “barely” drank before. Yah, I didn’t drink often, but when I did I would black out or get really sick. It’s called binge drinking and it’s not a positive thing. It’s super embarrassing.

Post Name: New Lawerence Red Line Stop Exterior at Night
Chicago's hottest nightclub
-------------
The CTA really surpassed expectations with this entire project. Can’t wait for the open space under the tracks to open
-------------
It's not as huge as the new stations but the section north of Belmont is so much better now with the flyover as well as the new track and interlocking.

I'm really impressed with RPM and hope they can get phase 2 rolling.
-------------
Reminds me of the new Tron marketing lol
-------------
THIS is where I like to see my tax dollars go. Looks amazing.
-------------
This club has everything!

Post Name: If you park like this with icy side walks, I hope you suffer unimaginable food poisoning
Chicago really needs a snitching app like NYC has for people like this
-------------
Call a tow company, if those shady fucks are as predatory as they seem to be this should be a feast.
-------------
As a wheelchair user in Chicago: They should be liable to be towed by a simple vigilante phone call to 311. This should be treated like parking in a handicap spot.

Edit: oh wow this is literally a block north of where I live!!! I need a mini ball peen hammer to mess these cars up
-------------
You see, you honor, I was minding my own business taking my pet sledge hammer for a walk when I slipped on the ice right beside this illegally parked car. My pet sledge hammer went through the window but was luckily ok. But, wouldn’t you know it, once I stood up, I slipped again. This time my pet hammer smashed into the door, but still luckily was unharmed. To make a long story short, I somehow slipped 21 times. That probably wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t trying to walk around the illegally parked car.
-------------
One was proposed! Didn't pass.
-------------
Just take pictures of the car and the plates, then go onto 311 and report a parking violation. Finance Parking Code Enforcement Review
-------------
I tried calling 311 but was on hold for too long and had to leave. But yeah I should have called one directly, didn’t think of that.
-------------
That only works if they’re going to be there for at least a week in my experience. Works for abandoned cars not so much immediate action
-------------
Lincoln towing is vastly corrupt and may love a call for this.
-------------
Never stopped them before

Post Name: Finally made it to the new Argyle stop at night
This is the stop by my mom's place. She never got to see this. She passed last month and was hoping to be able to take it again.
-------------
Now can they do this to all the stations (especially Roosevelt red line)
-------------
I'm so sorry for your loss :(
-------------
The update for this station is especially symbolic for first and second generation Southeast Asian Chicago generations. I’m so happy they gave the neighborhood the love it deserves.

Post Name: Pope Leo XIV points out the contradiction of being pro-life but supporting the death penalty
He is speaking so directly to MAGA, it's too bad their ears are clogged with Trump's bullshit.

My grandpa (and the whole fam) is from Chicago. Lifelong and devoted Catholic. Bears fan. Every reason to be excited about representation in his religion.

Unfortunately, loves trump more than the pope. Doesn't want to listen to a word he says. The same man who has believed God speaks through the pope directly.

Hell I think he loves trump more than God, and he's certainly not an outlier.
-------------
I can disagree with his anti-choice stance but still respect his willingness to reflect on the totality of what a self-proclaimed "pro-life" agenda would mean. Way ahead of like 99% of Xtians in this country.
-------------
This is nothing new for the Catholic Church however this is directly in response to Cardinal Cupich giving a lifetime achievement award to Dick Durbin. Naturally the tradcaths had a conniption

The pope stepped in to defend Durbin at that point. Later Durbin declined the award which would have been given Nov 3.
-------------
Is everything the Pope says and does relevant to Chicago since he is from Chicagoland?

Because if so, I am will gladly start posting Pope content here.
-------------
This was part of a defense of Cupich and Durbin, this one is relevant by that nature.
-------------
I mean, I do understand what you’re trying to say. But he is THE POPE, and the whole anti-abortion rhetoric is based within religion. There isn’t a world where a Pope *would* be pro-choice. To me, the fact that Pope Leo *is* coming forward to point out the hypocrisy of the Republican Party (supposedly America’s Christian party) is still surprising and novel.

Post Name: If you see ICE activity use the Waze app to mark an “icy road” hazard.
Great Idea, fuck ICE 🖕
-------------
Fuck ICE
-------------
It's a nice sentiment but there is no reason to reinvent the wheel as there are plenty of local orgs with rapid response networks.

It would be a better use of time to call the ICIRR and report any sightings 855-435-7693

Interesting idea.
-------------
Ahh my wife has been wondering why there are icy road alerts all week. Now we know! Useful. 

Can we all drive to icy roads and gridlock ice in place?
-------------
We can do both
