As a tourist, you likely won't need a car if you're staying near downtown as public transportation. Unlike Los Angeles, it's not very sprawled out until you get into the distant suburbs. Unlike New Yorkers, Chicagoans are friendly and not that snobbish. Chicago is a massive city that gets overshadowed by New York City and Los Angeles, despite having so much historical and economic significance.

In the Summer, Chicago has a plethora of festivals that attract thousands of people. In the Winter, there are lots of Christmas activities and the hotels are cheap given it's not a very popular time to travel. Safety however can be a minus in Chicago as some areas to the south can be very dangerous. I would feel uneasy being in those areas at night and I'm a fairly large guy.

**Negative: Orlando, Florida**. Orlando has some awesome attractions such as Disney World and Universal Studios Florida, but that's it. Most of Orlando is extremely sprawled out with many strip malls and giant parking lots next to massive roads. This is a city designed for cars and not people. It really sucks to walk from point A to point B even for distances less than a few hundred meters.

As a Portlander, I don't like Seattle (especially the people), but I still respect their public transportation, urban layout, and walkability. Seattle is a city designed for people and this makes it pleasant for me to visit Seattle whenever I go up there for a large event. Seattle has a very good job market which Orlando doesn't. If you're a child or a parent with children, Orlando is an awesome place to visit. If you're someone like me that likes to navigate the city and judges a city by it's urban layout, Orlando sucks ass. Even driving sucks in Orlando since I missed a turn to my hotel and got stuck behind traffic leaving Universal Studios during closing time. This added an extra 40 minutes to the already 7 hour drive from Atlanta to Orlando. I was a little pissed. I visited Orlando back in 2019 for a music festival which was a nice experience. I just despise Orlando as a city because it feels like a gargantuan, ugly, sprawled out suburb.]Post Name: [What's the cheapest of the cheap things you did to save money over your trip?]Upvotes: [245]Comment: [[removed]]Upvotes: [151]Comment: [The 3 biggest spendings for most travellers are: Accomodation, Transport and Food.

The best thing you can do in Venice imo is to just hit the top sights first and get them out of the way, then spend your time getting lost walking through alleyways and finding quiet streets.

Traditionally a "resort" is defined as being a self-contained destination with recreational opportunities, spas, entertainment, etc all on site.  Many also featured golf courses.  The intent was that folks staying at the hotel resort don't have to leave the property and thus spend more $$$ there.  Synergy!

It wasn't a requirement but many were located in more scenic areas that tourists visited.  Significantly these places were typically not attractive to the business crowd.

Today calling your property a "resort" is an excuse to tack on a per-night "resort" fee.
