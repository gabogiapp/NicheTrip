Hello,

Tomorrow we are visiting vatican and will have a lunch around that area. So far we visited 2 restaurants and sadly to say i was disappointed.
Hey all! Me and my girlfriend are heading back to Rome from the coast for 2 nights before we fly home. We had so many amazing meals in trastevere last week ( our favorite being da Fabrizio al 56 ). I was wondering if any of you locals had any suggestions for authentic Roman food. We like the classics, fried artichoke, fiore di zucca, carbonara, amatriciana, and tiramisu, but we want it to be legit like what we had at da fabrizio. 
Thanks all!
Hello, in october I'm coming to Rome with my mom and aunt. I was wondering if peeps here could recommend us some restaurants to try the best Rome (and Italy to the extent) has to offer do we can avoid tourist traps :D

Also if you have some cultural stuff you would recommend us to visit that would be awesome!

Greetings from Croatia <3

Edit: Also are there some things we should avoid as to not look like dumb disrespectful tourists?
As the title suggests staying near republica metro station next week and looking for the best recommendations for eating. Ready to stuff my face. 🐷 

We are staying fairly close to the center of all the main attractions, close to the river. We would love some recommendations on great, non-touristy places to eat. 
Hi everyone. I’m heading to Rome in a week and was hoping to get some restaurant recommendations that would be easy for 2 people to get in. I’ve had bad luck with tourist traps in the past and am looking to avoid this. Also if anyone has good aperitivo places I’d love to know as well. Thanks so much!
I am a fresh student in Rome. I want to find some place good to have lunch in.
I’m a student studying abroad with John Cabot University and I have been loving both the occasional night out and cooking at home. 

My parents will be visiting at the end of the term, and I’m trying to twist their arm into buying my dinner lol, what’s a place that you love that’s out of a student budget, but would be worth spending a family dinner at? 
Im off to Rome tomorrow and I've been told there's some good places to eat in Trastevere but I'm after some really nice restaurants
