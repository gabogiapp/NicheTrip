Yes it has some social deprivation, but it’s also regenerated a lot and has lots of things to offer. 

Walkable city centre, grand architecture, the friendliest people in England, the most museums out of any British city besides London (and of an exceptionally high quality at that), a good music scene, and an interesting multicultural heritage (Chinese, African, Welsh, Irish among others). 

You’re also completely surrounded by amazing nature - Snowdonia National Park in North Wales to your west, the Shropshire Hills to the south, the Lake District to the north, and the Peak District to the east.

What’s not to like? Liverpool’s a great place to visit.]Upvotes: [290]Comment: [Paris]Upvotes: [133]Comment: [Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. Went in expecting to feel guarded 24/7.

Mexico City - really affordable, amazing food, and I love all the museums and ruins right here in the city.

New Orleans - some of the best food I’ve ever eaten and I love how spooky and haunted it is.

Prague - beautiful city, love the art and architecture. Not to mention the awesome touristy absinthe bar my SO and I went to a few times. 

Granada - I studied there for a semester, totally a nostalgia pick for me. Plus it’s be cool to hang out with my Spanish friends and smoke a hookah at the teteria again.

Amsterdam - I love how walkable it is and how pretty with all the canals and old houses/buildings. The snack food scene is lowbrow but great (shout out FEBO) and if be lying if I said I wouldn’t be a coffeeshop regular.]Upvotes: [189]Comment: [1. Seoul (culture, food, and nightlife)

I quite like Salzburg which has a lot of good hiking trails and also cheap as a main point. 

Lljubjana is great for a few days in Slovenia, you can head through the Italian lakes for some good scenery, I usually go Como.

South of Germany near zugspitze is pretty great, garmin paltenkrischen is a lovely little town nearby it

TIPS / TAKEAWAYS / THINGS I WISH I KNEW**

 * Pack half the clothes and twice the money, you will buy stuff and you'll wish you had more space.
 * Get out of your comfort zone. I'm usually quite introverted but when you travel you can be anyone you want to be. You carry no baggage when travelling in the social sense, people you meet are all fresh and have no idea about your past. You can be shy, introverted, extroverted, or crazy it's up to you. Also, don't be afraid of what people are going to think, I would ask the craziest questions to people, nothing was taboo and it made people really open up and have interesting conversations. People attested to the fact telling me I asked good questions which did indeed make me happy.
 * Don't plan too much. I planned my whole trip to the minute, with all my hostels, trains and planes booked before I even landed. In hindsight, this worked out great but there were times when I wished I did have a degree of flexibility available to me. I did have instances where I met people and was invited to join them to their next destination however wasn't able to. For my next trip, I'll definitely only try and book my first few night's accommodations and do a general plan, it's a bit more stressful to be spontaneous but I feel it would be much more rewarding.
 * Say yes to everything (within reason). Invited to explore the city, say yes, invited to join strangers for dinner, say yes, invited to the pub crawl, say yes, invited to go skydiving, say yes. Get out of your comfort zone, you will regret things which you didn't do, so say yes more often.
 * Take very good care of your feet and get really good broken-in shoes. I took a cheap pair of reebok classics and it was a bad idea, I bought a brand new pair prior to leaving and got the worst blisters for weeks. I was walking minimum 20k steps a day so my feet got really sore. Make sure your shoes are broken in and high quality, I'd recommend a pair of Salomon walking shoes that are discreet and can be dressed up.
 * Know your alcohol tolerance. With hostels and solo travelling, you're going to be drinking a lot, know how much you can take otherwise you're going to forget a lot of things and may end up in bad situations, I speak from experience.
 * Bathrooms and benches are rare in Europe. I think this is common knowledge at this point but I was shocked to realise that using the bathroom costs money in Europe. They also seem to have an alarming lack of places to sit down.
 * Don't be overly frugal. If you want to do something, do it, who knows when you're going to be back in that place to try it again, yolo.
 * Shared experiences are the best part of solo travelling. Honestly, solo travelling is anything but that, you do indeed travel solo but you meet so many people along the way and do so much together with other people. Doing cool things together with people is what you're going to cherish the most and remember as being the highlight of your trip.
 * There are up's and downs. Not every place is going to be amazing with incredible people in your hostel. Who is in your hostel during your stay comes down to luck, sure most people in hostels are cool and down to earth but sometimes you'll run into people that don't want to bother socialising and that's fine. Learn to love your own company, put in some earphones and go explore.
 * Trains > planes in Europe. If your train journey is over 7 hours only then I would consider a plane, trains are just too good to pass up.
 * Travel will allow you to see your life back home from a third person's perspective. You can definitely get an idea of things you can improve on back home, it also allows you to shift your perceptions and reevaluate how you currently live your life and gives you a new understanding of what truly matters to you. I know it's cliche to say that travel changes you but it truly does I believe.
 * It's an incredible experience. I have zero regrets about this trip, in fact, I'd say it's one of the best decisions I've ever made and definitely given me the travel bug to go out and explore the world and meet new people. Just do it if you're on the fence, you'll thank yourself.]Post Name: [Went to Paris for a Hans Zimmer concert, stayed for the food and the views.

The best thing you can do in Venice imo is to just hit the top sights first and get them out of the way, then spend your time getting lost walking through alleyways and finding quiet streets. Grab a coffee and watch the gondolas float by! And I thought Venice was most beautiful at night time, almost otherworldly.

I was hooked on Bangkok the moment i got there, it was all incredibly stimulating, modern but traditional. rough round the edges but still mostly safe.

It is bewildering to see a set of old steel mill row houses though where one has a Sotheby’s real estate sign in front. Would have been a complete joke in the city when I grew up.

We were there for a "bike and barge trip" and couldn't fit it in.

When were in London we didn't watch the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. Neither of us had any desire to see it.

When we were in Rome, we went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner one night. People thought we were crazy when we told them this, but we enjoyed it. And of course we had the best Italian food 2-3x times a day for the other 9 days.]Upvotes: [251]Comment: [I went to Amsterdam and didn’t do anything weed related, red light related, bike related, flower related, van gough related, or Ann frank related.

To save money I found a cabin an hour and a half outside of the park. The plan was to drive from the south entrance to the cabin (by the east entrance) on day 1 and then drive back into the park for day 2. I didn’t realize 1.5 hours outside of Yellowstone is 3-4 hours from things like Old Faithful. We weren’t willing to spend 8 hours in the car, so I took my family to Yellowstone and we did not see Old Faithful. We ended up hanging out near Meeteetsee where our cabin was and it was great. 

From then on, we started camping because we could affordable stay so much closer to the attractions in the national parks.]Upvotes: [157]Comment: [The secret to the Louvre is you have to take frequent breaks at the little cafes by the wing entrances. Have a coffee or a muffin, people watch, then go do that wing.

Sure if you pay for tickets for every museum, attractio and whatnot, it can be tight, but those are mostly superfluous and if you stick to the main ones it will be just fine.]Upvotes: [175]Comment: [My suggestion: Don't stay in Dublin for 12 days. 3 to 4 are enough.

SNCF, RATP etc is not is not equipped/trained to handle this. 
It’s not like this is government land on which you have a human right to occupy. 

+++ we have enough heated churches in Paris to safely house every single homeless person every night.
