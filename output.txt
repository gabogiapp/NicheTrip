I’m glad you had a good experience with Vietnam’s healthcare system and recognized how affordable it can be, especially compared to the U.S. But also your tone drips with tourist privilege.

You got access and special treatment partly because you’re a foreigner with money, time, and the flexibility to move around. Something that many locals especially rural or lower-income Vietnamese, don’t have. You casually mention how you could have haggled down the price of blood tests (which already underpays doctors and staff), or how you walked into national hospitals and were seen quickly but the average Vietnamese person might wait much longer, deal with underfunded local clinics, or avoid care altogether because even $6 can be a burden for them.

The fact that meds are cheaper in Vietnam is less about some magic “Asia pill” and more about the predatory pricing of U.S. pharma and insurance.

It’s great you had an eye opening experience, but maybe next time, reflect a bit more on why things worked the way they did for you and what local people’s reality looks like.]Upvotes: [168]Comment: [A PCR is an extremely expensive lab procedure?

OK this is really weird. So the tour guide will actually shut up and either skip part of what they intended to tell you or waste your time by making you wait there until they feel nobody's attempting to listen to them any more? Doesn't sound like providing a good service, AT ALL.

What does it matter for them anyway? They're still getting paid?

Once I was on a group tour and a couple actually joined our group to listen to our guide - discretely, but went along with us for a long time. When we would stop, they would stop a bit to the side, not messing with any of the group members' ability to stay near the guide and listen. They were cool. Our guide paid zero attention to them.

With the help of a good friend, I realized that I kept putting off recreational traveling primarily because I was very hesitant to travel alone. It was at that time that I decided to make the time in my busy volleyball schedule and just give solo traveling a try.

I planned a 2 week trip to İstanbul for April 2023. About 5 days before my scheduled trip, my AirBnB host informed me they had COVID and I needed to find a new AirBnB ASAP, which I was able to do.

#Heartless Airline Throws Innocent Child to the Wolves

In a shocking display of corporate greed and utter disregard for human life, budget airline Wizz Air has left a terrified 14-year-old boy stranded in a foreign country. The innocent child, returning home from a sports camp in sunny Italy, was subjected to a nightmare ordeal that would make even the most hardened traveler shudder.

After being forced to pay extortionate fees for the audacity of checking in at the airport counter, the young victim was then callously denied a seat on his booked flight. But the horror didn’t stop there. In a move that defies belief, Wizz Air callously bumped the child from the overbooked flight, leaving him alone and vulnerable in a strange land.

The airline’s response to this humanitarian crisis? A paltry €250 in compensation and a flight to Iceland – a whole week away! As if that wasn’t bad enough, Wizz Air’s heartless staff showed a complete lack of empathy, insisting they had no idea how old the child was. It’s almost as if they believed they were dealing with a piece of luggage, rather than a frightened and bewildered teenager.

Thankfully, the boy was taken in by a kind-hearted family who were also victims of Wizz Air’s overbooking scandal. However, his distraught parents were forced to fork out a small fortune for a last-minute flight to bring their son home safely.

This is not the first time Wizz Air has been accused of such appalling behavior. Countless passengers have shared horror stories of being overbooked, mistreated, and left stranded. It’s time for aviation authorities to take action against this rogue airline and hold them accountable for their reckless disregard for passenger safety and well-being.

I grew up in FL eating amazing Cuban food.  I learned if you want good Cuban food, go to FL, NOT Cuba

Better than expected: Dubai. 
Dubai gets a lot of hate, but get away from the malls and fancy restaurants, and go to where the working class immigrants live and eat.  Its hard to find a city with so many diverse, unique and authentic options]Upvotes: [128]Comment: [rainstorm uppity imagine compare agonizing theory dolls books slap meeting

Absolutely tasteless. We usually get a cookbook focused on local cuisine when we travel somewhere and didn't even bother in NZ.

Definitely France for worse than expected - they have a superiority complex when it comes to food that isn't warranted]Upvotes: [295]Comment: [The thing that impressed the most with Georgia was the quality of the simplest things.

100% this. I ate *very* well in London when I went in 2022 because I had a list longer than my arm of places to try LOL
And an unreasonable high food budget because I cheaped out on everything else]Upvotes: [137]Comment: [lol I just posted a comment about how I know a lot of ppl from Texas who fuck with Vietnamese food heavy]Upvotes: [111]Comment: [I knew pho was good. But that is a small part of their cuisine, usually eaten at breakfast or lunch. 
It was everything else they have that blew my mind.]Upvotes: [161]Comment: [Agreed.

And, I get it. Much like a 20th century communist country, Colombia is a country that was locked away and isolated from the world for decades while culinary methodologies were transferred and spread throughout the world due to globalization. Just for contrast, Ecuadorian and Peruvian cuisine next door is excellent.]Upvotes: [129]Comment: [Pho, like a lot of Vietnamese cuisine is an every meal food. Not just breakfast.

When I’m traveling I’m always prepared that people scream ni hao at me (I’m not Chinese) or stare at me - like you experienced but nothing could prepare me for the racism in Italy.

I was traveling with my white blonde hair blue eyed friend. Everywhere (in Rome) we went I was blatantly ignored. At a restaurant outside the Vatican, they would only take her order then leave before I could place mine. The waiter didn’t even look at me or face me. At the airport , I had the flight info on my phone but they would only address and speak to her. It was one of the worst experiences traveling to be disregarded and ignored. I don’t know what’s wrong with Italian people.

I do have to say, the further south we went the less racism I felt. I had no issues in Sorento and definitely no issues in Sicily. 

But that experience put a bad taste in my mouth and I won’t return to Italy even though I want to go to Florence]Upvotes: [296]Comment: [Same thing happened in our Italian trip with my girl friends. All of us are Asians. While we were waiting for train in Milano train station, police officers suddenly stopped and asked only our group to present our passports. After the passport check, they didn’t even bother to check our face and return the right ones to us, instead they called out our names (we felt like they didn’t care to recognise us). The station was crowded btw. 


All of us felt that some servers and locals were indifferent and noticeably rude towards us.]Upvotes: [319]Comment: [Honestly this is very present for Asian people travelling to Europe, I’m sorry about it. I’ve heard it from my Korean and Chinese friends that they couldn’t vacation there anymore with how bad it is, I’m sorry with the hand you were dealt]Upvotes: [190]Comment: [Thank you for sharing this. These type of trip reports do not get enough recognition. Another biggest culprit is France. My east asian family get a lot of microaggression there too. This is really a shame, because actually france and italy are my bucketlist.

Just wait until someone else start making post about how people in Italy is "wonderful" and that they have not experienced any of the rudeness.... and then we discovered they are whites.

I know how to deal with it generally, but it still isn’t something I want happening. I feel bad for those from East Asia who honestly might be treated even more “powerlessly” by rude racist locals. And of course I know other types of POC must have it worse unfortunately.

I also had great experiences in Italy with locals - and honestly basically all of my interactions in Spain, Denmark, France, Austria, Sweden, and Germany were neutral to friendly.

Interestingly enough, Portugal was the least friendly country on average. I felt a similar level of hostility/meanness/stares, but no particular incident happened like these in Italy.
