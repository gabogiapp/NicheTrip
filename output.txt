Just a friendly reminder ‚Ä¶ in Italy , tipping is not mandatory at restaurants. You can leave a few euros (in cash) on the table as a gesture of appreciation if the service was very good but by no means do we have a culture of tipping 15% + per meal. By doing this you are creating a shift in the way restaurants charge for meals .. lately in the center I‚Äôve had a few waiters tell me that the bill did not include ‚Äúthe service charge‚Äù , implying they expected a tip separately. This is completely wrong - again, waiters get paid a full salary and in Italy it is not mandatory. 

*If they do this they are trying to take advantage of you.*

Please reconsider before bringing your customs to other countries when traveling. When in Rome , do as the Romans do! 
Hello I was wondering if I could get some advice on what restaurants to go to in Rome. I have probably watched and read hundreds of videos/blogs/food guides for Rome - but I‚Äôm still scared. 

My family and I never travel often so I may seem dramatic but this is a big deal to me. I really don‚Äôt want to waste a meal and I want it to be authentic food you know. I see locals from Italy on social media condemning touristy restaurants etc and I really don‚Äôt want to fall into that trap. 

I even have a lot of restaurants pinned on my google maps too. I don‚Äôt even know how to go about reservations either for most of these. 

As you can see I‚Äôm a very stressed person and I just want things to go smoothly üò≠üò≠haha thanks in advance 
I think as soon as I saw the scam restaurants that all literally look the same with their gas heating lamps and plastic tent exterior seating in the city center I knew that I'm not going to bother with finding a good authentic restaurant in Rome. Even more so finding one that I could afford.

Instead I found myself a nice aupermarket in the neighbourhood with an amazing Gastronomia and Panetteria section and got myself a daily selection of Prosciuttos, Cheeses, Olives and assorted Anitpasti, Bread etc. to eat in the Hotel Room or a quiet corner in a park.
I've compiled a list of restaurants for my Italy trip. I am not going to be able to go to all of these restaurants, so I would love your thoughts. Everything sounds so good, but who knows!

Got these recommendations mostly from reddit, google reviews, and a few blogs/youtube videos. I'm skeptical of anything with too many google reviews! 

***I need some more options for around Vatican City and Aperitif spots- and dessert!*** Staying in Monti area, but have plans all over usual tourist circuit.

My palette is pretty varied. For background, I am South Asian, but live in USA (in one of the most diverse cities in USA). My partner and I love bright, bold flavors and appreciate delicate and food that tastes fresh. We do like the heavier stuff, but are looking for variety across restaurants.

Dishes I am excited to eat are: Osso Buco, Carbonara, Fish dishes, Cacio e Pepe, Suppli, Tiramisu, Amatriciana, Maritozzi, Artichokes, Squash blossom. Always open to expanding this list.

Friends, I‚Äôm visiting Rome from NYC and I want to eat authentic Roman food. I don‚Äôt care about the location, price, or service. I only care about the food being the real deal.

For reference, if anyone here is from NYC, my favorite Italian spots are Bar Pitti (but only the specials off the blackboard). I also enjoy Piccola Cucina and Song‚Äô e Napule for pizza. I do **NOT** like Don Angie, Carbone, I Sodi, or any of those gimmicky ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù places in the city.

Here‚Äôs my Rome restaurant list. Please pick it apart and tell me which ones aren‚Äôt worth visiting and should be removed. Also, if I missed any must-visit places. Please let me know! 

I really appreciate the help.
Had dinner last night at Vin Allegro in Trastevere at 8pm.  (Despite what Reddit says, I hear a ton of people speaking Italian yet reddit says its only tourists here...)

We have a group of 4, my wife and I made reservation under my American name, my two adult sons made their reservation under a fake Italian name 

My wife and I were seated in the corner, far away from other diners and next to AC heat pump unit

My sons were seated in middle

Our waiter then said the card machine is broken, cash only, and told me I'd have to walk to ATM 

(Which i did)

My sons were able to pay with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Visa, and were not asked to pay cash. I literally saw them tap the card.

Is this typical?  Do vendors do this to avoid paying taxes?

Enjoyed a drink afterwards at Freni Frenzo

2. Roma Sparita ‚Äì Reservations open 15 days ahead (i like to plan everything early so this stinks)
3. Vanda ‚Äì Accepts reservations?
4. Osteria il Botticelli ‚Äì Accepts reservations?
5. Da Fabrizio al 56 ‚Äì Accepts reservations

I'm currently in rome for the First time for a couple more days. I keep eating at restaurant that have 4.3+ stars but honestly they have been a let down. Is there any reccomendations for my last couple of meals? 
Hello,

Tomorrow we are visiting vatican and will have a lunch around that area. So far we visited 2 restaurants and sadly to say i was disappointed.
