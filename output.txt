But: No way you can walk around after a surgery, the leg needs to lay and rest.

And being on crutches is bloody exhausting, as you only can use the good leg for the next 4-8 weeks.

Contact yor travel insurance to find you a nice place where you can rest.

It sucks that your trip is being cut short by a driver‚Äôs carelessness;it truly isn‚Äôt fair at all. But the reality is that you‚Äôre dealing with a really big injury and you need to do the recovery and rehab correctly to avoid giving yourself complications and problems down the track.

You will be dealing with bruising, swelling, pain and tiredness from not being able to walk normally. You‚Äôre at higher risk of blood clots and infections for now, too. It‚Äôs extra hot with stuff on your leg and it‚Äôs a bit nerve-wracking being in big groups/crowded areas‚Ä¶ You need to spend a lot of next few weeks with your leg still and elevated, and you really need to avoid getting too sweaty inside your dressings, especially if they‚Äôre casting it. 

You need to check out your travel insurance, too. You may lose cover for anything else that happens if you continue to travel, if the doctors recommend returning home. 

I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs shit.]Upvotes: [121]Comment: [‚ÄúI am thinking about continuing on crutches‚Äù

Ha, no. Your body needs some serious healing time. You need to stay in Italy until you‚Äôre well enough to get a plane home. This is a months-long process. Even when surgery is done and the cast is off, you need to re-learn how to use that leg.

Berlin, Prague and Croatia will still be there when you‚Äôre ready to go in the future.]Post Name: [Itinerary Help - 70 days in Europe]Post Name: [Itinerary advice for a longer Europe trip]Post Name: [5 days in Namibia]Upvotes: [328]Comment: [What‚Äôs in that tree?]Upvotes: [258]Comment: [Is the ‚Äúno walking after sunset‚Äù because of animals?]Upvotes: [107]Comment: [This looks wonderful.

Hell, it fits all the criteria so hard it even have 1.3 million people.  Not less than 1 million, not more than 1.5.

Not a dead town, not overcrowded.

Not a big downtown, but it has everything you need.  (probably not everything you WANT, but hey)

Due to the small downtown, it's pretty much walkable with decent public transport connecting to main hubs of the city.  Back in my previous visit, riding the light-rail train within the downtown was FREE.  You only need a ticket if you start or end at a out-of-downtown station.

Not a crazy food scene, but it has enough.

Technically not a touristy town, but it does have a tower, a nice mall and a nice park.

Bonus point, reasonably close to one of the most famous national park in the country.
