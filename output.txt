• Martha's, 4115 Guadalupe and Westside Mkt
• Ivester Contemporary (located in canopy near

• Women & Their Work
• Co-Lab Projects
• UT's Visual Arts Center

Art Museums/Parks - not many in this town, sadly:

• The Blanton (on UT campus)
• The Carver Museum
• MexicArte
• Umlauf Sculpture Garden
• The People's Gallery at City Hall
• Landmark self-guided tour at UT campus

Art classes:

• The Contemporary ATX Laguna Gloria Art School
• Atelier Dojo
• Broad Studios
• Future Front Texas
• Dougherty Arts Center
• Something Cool Studios
• Austin School of Film
• You can find even more with a simple google search. A lot of artists offer classes independently, which I recommend as that allows artists to keep more $ for themselves.]Upvotes: [254]Comment: [There's also off the top of my head
